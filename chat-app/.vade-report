# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

## Summary
Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for this Next.js App Router project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/analytics` package using npm
- Updated `package.json` to include the new dependency
- Updated `package-lock.json` with resolved dependencies

### 2. Analytics Integration
Modified `app/layout.tsx`:
- Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next"`
- Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, after the ThemeProvider closing tag
- The component is properly placed to track page views across the entire application

## Implementation Details

**Location**: `app/layout.tsx` (Root Layout)
- The Analytics component was added at the end of the body tag, following Next.js best practices
- This placement ensures analytics tracking is initialized for all pages in the application
- The existing code structure was preserved, with no breaking changes to other components

## Verification

✅ **Build**: Successfully verified that the project builds without errors using `npm run build`
✅ **Linter**: Ran `npm run lint` - no new linting errors introduced by the changes
✅ **Dependencies**: All lock files properly updated

## Notes

- The Analytics component will automatically track page views when deployed to Vercel
- No additional configuration is required - the component works out of the box
- Analytics data will be visible in the Vercel dashboard once deployed
- The integration follows the official Vercel documentation for Next.js App Router projects
